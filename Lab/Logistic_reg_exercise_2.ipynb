    "# Exercise: Movie Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with a dataset containing information about movies, including their marketing expenses, production expenses, multiplex coverage, budget, movie length, ratings of lead actors, lead actresses, directors, and producers, critic ratings, trailer views, 3D availability, time taken for production, Twitter hashtags, genre, average age of actors, number of multiplexes, collections, and whether the movie started a technical Oscar nomination or not. This dataset offers valuable insights into the factors contributing to a movie's success and its chances of receiving a technical Oscar nomination. Analyzing the patterns in this dataset can help stakeholders in the movie industry make better-informed decisions regarding movie production, promotion, and targeting specific audience demographics.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Critic_rating: Rating given by movie critics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trailer_views: The number of views of the movie's trailer\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3D_available: Whether the movie is available in 3D (YES/NO)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time_taken: Time taken for the movie's production in days\n",
    "\n",
    "- Twitter_hastags: The number of Twitter hashtags related to the movie\n",
    "\n",
    "- Genre: The genre of the movie (Action, Comedy, Drama, Thriller, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avg_age_actors: The average age of the actors in the movie\n",
    "\n",
    "- Num_multiplex: The number of multiplexes where the movie is being shown\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collection: The total box office collection of the movie\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start_Tech_Oscar: Whether the movie started a technical Oscar nomination (1 for yes, 0 for no). This column serves as the output label, while the remaining columns are input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "**Now, you are requried to import sklearn library and build a Logistic Regression model for this classification task.**\n",
    "- Start_Tech_Oscar is the <u>output label</u> \n",
    "- The rest columns are the <u>input features</u>. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "At a minimum, you should include steps such as simple Data Exploration/Visualization, Data Pre-processing including Normalization, Model Building, Model Evaluation, and Making Predictions with the Model."
